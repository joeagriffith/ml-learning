Setup – create a population of n elements, each with randomly generated DNA
Gen_pop(n, length) -> Vec<String>

Selection – evaluate the fitness of each element of the population and build a mating pool.
Fitness = difference from target string
Create a vector of fitnesses, element by element relationship to population vec
Calculate total of fitnessVec
Mating pool = Vec with length population
For each element in population, insert into mating pool  len(population) * fitness/fitness_total times.

Reproduction – repeat N times
-	Randomly pick two parents from mating pool
-	Crossover the two parents, 50% chance for each char
-	Mutation, 50% chance that a string has 1 random char
-	Add new child to the new population
REPEAT FORM SELECTION
